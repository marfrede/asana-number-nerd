<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.asana-number-nerd.com">Asana Number Nerd</a></strong> has just one simple task: to <span class="highlight">number your Asana
    tasks</span>.</p>
<p>It is designed to assign <span class="highlight">unique task numbers</span> to tasks created in Asana, counting
  from 1.</p>
<p>This could be useful for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>users that are <span class="highlight">managing a large number of tasks</span> and need a clear way to keep
    track of them.</li>
  <li>users that <span class="highlight">report or share their tasks with others</span> and need to reference them
    by a specific number.</li>
  <li>developers that want to <span class="highlight">reference the task numbers in branch names</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This app is focused on making the task management process <span class="highlight">more organized and
    efficient</span> for Asana users.</p>
<p>The Task Number will be assigned as Prefix of the Tasks name., e.g. "make coffee" -> "#025 make coffee" </p>
